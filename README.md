**Why MajorMap?**

University curricula can span 40+ courses with tangled prerequisite webs, forcing you to juggle catalogs, advisor meetings, and half-remembered requirements.
<br>
<br>

With MajorMap, you get an interactive roadmap of every course, clear prerequisite paths, what-if planning tools, semantic course search, and opportunties for research, internships, and networking / L&D events right in one centralized location.
