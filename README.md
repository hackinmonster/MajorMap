## MajorMap is a degree planning platform for UNCC students.

**Why MajorMap?**

University curricula can span 40+ courses with tangled prerequisite webs, forcing you to juggle catalogs, advisor meetings, and half-remembered requirements.
<br>
<br>

With MajorMap, you get an interactive roadmap of every course, clear prerequisite paths, what-if planning tools, semantic course search, and opportunties for research, internships, and networking / L&D events right in one centralized location.

## Semantic Search Setup

For the full semantic search experience, you'll need an OpenAI API key:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

Without an API key, the system will fall back to keyword-based search.
